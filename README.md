SentinelCloud is a Real-time Safety Net. It's a system designed to watch over industrial equipment using IoT sensors. It collects thousands of data points every second and uses a 'smart brain' to detect emergencies instantly. For example, if a sensor in a building detects smoke, my system ensures the alarm goes off in less than a millisecond, potentially saving lives.
